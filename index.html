<p>Gourav Takhar is a PhD student at IIT Kanpur with a focus on &quot;synthesis for security and bug finding.&quot; He has published research on security in esteemed conferences such as TACAS, CAV, ASE, HOST, and ICCAD. He also got a best paper award in ICCAD for his work in validating hyper-properties for system-on-chip designs. More recently, he has been working on synthesizing techniques for program verification, specifically addressing incorrectness logic. Additionally, Gourav has developed tools for learning program verification and testing.</p>
<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>
<p>I am interested in the Formal Methods domain. Following are some of the specific areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional Synthesis for Logic Locking (used to stop Intellectual Property (IP) piracy).</li>
<li>Function Synthesis for verification of buffer overflow safety properties of &quot;Open Programs&quot;.</li>
<li>Function Synthesis for bug finding in programs using Incorrectness Logic.</li>
<li>Formal methods for co-verification of hardware (HW) and firmware (FW).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also interested in artificial intelligence for program verification, program testing, and hardware circuit design synthesis.</p>
